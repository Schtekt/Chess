# Chess

My take on a chess application.
The ambition is to be able to play local games of chess with a stretch goal to implement AI and allow users to script and add their own AIs to the game.

This project is currently built on a windows machine and is therefore only supported on that operating system.

In order to be able to generate the projects, so that one may use either vscode or visual studio, the following three things need to be downloaded and installed.
* **Visual studio code** (Can be found here https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

* **MSBuild**, this can be obtained with ["Build tools for visual studio"](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe). Make sure to add the MSBuild bin directory to PATH.

* **Premake5**, can be downloaded from the premake [website](https://premake.github.io/). Make sure to add it to PATH.
